# factor

A Rust crate for factoring integers.

Written for academic porpoises, which are like dolphins, except that they really enjoy static type checking.

## Using factor

Add this to Cargo.toml:

    [dependencies.factor]
    git = "https://github.com/ExpHP/rust-factor"

And place this in your source file:

    extern crate factor;

Of course, my advice for now is __don't depend on factor__, as I kind of doubt I'll be around to maintain it for very long.  Or beyond next wednesday, even.
